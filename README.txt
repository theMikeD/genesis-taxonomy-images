Create and manage taxonomy images for themes using the Genesis framework.

Based on "Genesis Taxonomy Images" plugin Copyright 2013 Ade Walker/studiograsshopper (info@studiograsshopper.ch)

== Description ==

Once activated, this plugin enables you to upload and display an image for your taxonomy terms. Think of it as featured images for terms. It works with categories, tags, and custom taxonomies.

The plugin uses the term meta functionality built into WordPress to store the taxonomy image ID.

Note: this plugin is designed for use with the Genesis theme framework version 2 or greater, and will not work without it.

== Installation ==

Either use the WordPress Plugin Installer (Dashboard > Plugins > Add New, then search for "genesis taxonomy images"), or manually as follows:

1. Upload the entire `genesis-taxonomy-images` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. DO NOT change the name of the `genesis-taxonomy-images` folder
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress Dashboard

You can now add images to any taxonomy by visiting the taxonomy admin page.

Note: You must be using a Genesis child theme with Genesis version 2 or greater or the plugin will not activate.

Note for WordPress Multisite users:

* Install the plugin in your */plugins/* directory (do not install in the */mu-plugins/* directory).
* In order for this plugin to be visible to Site Admins, the plugin has to be activated for each blog by the Network Admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get Support? =

Guidance on using the plugin can be found in the plugin's [User Guide](https://www.codenamemiked.com/plugins/genesis-taxonomy-images/genesis-taxonomy-images-user-guide/).

If you're still stuck or you think you fod a bug, you can post a message on the plugin's [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/genesis-taxonomy-images).

Support is provided in my free time but every effort will be made to respond to support queries as quickly as possible.

Source code can be found in [github](https://github.com/theMikeD/genesis-taxonomy-images).

= Where is the Settings page? =

There is no need for a Settings page. Images are uploaded/added via the Dashboard Edit screen for the taxonomy term in question.

= How do I display these images in my theme? =

You need to add some code to your Genesis Child Theme's `functions.php` file. Code examples can be found in the plugin's [User Guide](https://www.codenamemiked.com/plugins/genesis-taxonomy-images/genesis-taxonomy-images-user-guide/).

= Does this plugin support custom taxonomies? =
Yep.

= Can you be more specific? =
This plugin supports any taxonomy that has 'show_ui' set to true in its declaration.

= Can I disable it for a specific taxonomy?
Yes, but it requires coding. There is a filter to manipulate the supported taxonomies. Look for the `gtaxi_get_taxonomies` filter for more.

== Other Notes ==

This plugin is designed for use with the Genesis theme framework version 2 or greater, and will not work without it.

Having said that, the actual image ID is saved using standard WordPress term taxonomy tools, so even if you eventually disable this plugin, your images will still be linked to your terms. See the [User Guide](https://www.codenamemiked.com/plugins/genesis-taxonomy-images/genesis-taxonomy-images-user-guide/) for more on this.
